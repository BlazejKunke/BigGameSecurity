# GameProject

This directory contains a minimal C# game layout intended as a starting point for small console-based prototypes. The structure separates runtime code, content assets, and utility scripts to make it easy to grow into a larger project.

```
GameProject/
├── GameProject.sln           # Solution that groups all C# projects
├── README.md                 # Overview of the layout
├── assets/                   # Audio, textures, fonts, and other external assets
├── content/                  # Data-driven content such as levels or dialogue
├── src/
│   └── GameProject/          # Primary game executable project
│       ├── Game/             # Core game loop and state management
│       ├── Entities/         # Game entities and supporting types
│       └── Scenes/           # Scene implementations and interfaces
└── tools/                    # Helper scripts and utilities
```

To build and run the project:

```bash
cd src/GameProject
dotnet run
```

The default implementation wires up a very small scene system that prints output to the console. Replace the placeholder logic with your own rendering, physics, and input handling as your project evolves.
